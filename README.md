# Decision_Making_Using_Bayesian-RoboSim

This is the code for generating the RoboSim model from data set and bayesian network.
This is for the scenario OverTaking.

1. The data is stored in Data.csv.
2. The model of LSTM for prediction is stored in vehicle-behavior.h5.
3. The Bayesian network learnt from Data.csv is stored in bayesNetwork.xdsl.
4. The output RoboSim model is stored in output.txt.
